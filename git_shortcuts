git revert
<commit>
Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in <commit>, then apply it to the current branch.

<name> <url>
Create a new connection to a remote repo. After adding a remote, you can use <name> as a shortcut for <url> in other commands.

git diff
Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory.

git commit -m
"<message>"
Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use <message> as the commit message.

git init
<directory>
Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments to initialize the current directory as a git repository.


git commit
